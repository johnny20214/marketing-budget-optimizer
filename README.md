## üéØ Project Overview

In a competitive market, allocating a marketing budget effectively is a critical challenge. This project addresses this problem by providing a "Decision Analytics" tool that allows a user to:
1.  **Understand** the impact of spending in different channels (TV, Radio, Newspaper).
2.  **Optimize** a given budget for maximum sales, based on a predictive model.
3.  **Simulate** different spending scenarios to make informed strategic decisions.

The application is built on a robust linear regression model with an **R-squared of 0.903**, ensuring that its recommendations are based on statistically significant relationships within the data.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **üìà Predictive Modeling:** Uses a Scikit-learn regression model to forecast sales based on advertising spend.
*   **üí° Smart Optimization:** Leverages SciPy's optimization engine to find the ideal budget allocation that maximizes predicted sales.
*   **üéõÔ∏è Interactive Scenario Planning:** Users can manually adjust spend in each channel with sliders to see the immediate impact on sales forecasts.
*   **üè¢ Business Constraint Integration:** The tool was enhanced to allow users to set minimum spending thresholds for each channel, turning a purely mathematical solution into a realistic, strategy-aware recommendation engine.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Language:** Python
*   **Core Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, SciPy
*   **Web Framework & UI:** Streamlit
*   **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
*   **Deployment:** Streamlit Community Cloud (via GitHub)

## Ï±å Challenge & Key Learning: From Insight to Improvement

A key challenge encountered during this project became its most valuable feature. The initial optimization model consistently recommended a 100% budget allocation to the single most effective channel (Radio).

*   **Problem:** While mathematically correct, this result lacked real-world business viability, as it ignored the strategic importance of a multi-channel presence and the concept of market saturation.
*   **Action:** I diagnosed this as a limitation of a purely linear model and reframed the problem. The goal wasn't just to find the mathematical maximum, but the *best outcome within realistic business constraints*.
*   **Solution:** I enhanced the application by adding interactive sliders for users to define their own business rules (e.g., "must spend at least 10% on TV"). The optimization engine was re-engineered to incorporate these constraints.
*   **Result:** This transformed the tool from a simple calculator into a true strategic asset, demonstrating an ability to bridge the gap between technical data analysis and actionable business strategy.
